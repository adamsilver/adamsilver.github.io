# Hey, I'm Adam Silver. I strive to make the web [simple]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}) and human for [everyone](/articles/the-role-of-the-front-end-developer/#accessibility). I specialise in [UX](/articles/hello-ux-designer/), [Front-end Engineering](/articles/the-role-of-the-front-end-developer/) and [Strategy](/articles/how-we-cut-our-mvp-in-half-to-launch-kidly/).

## Speaking

Sometimes I [speak at conferences]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}). If you would like me to speak at yours just [send me a message](mailto:adambsilver+speaking@gmail.com).

## Writing

In addition to this blog, I write for [Simple=Human](http://medium.com/simple-human)&mdash;a Medium publication I started with my friend [Mark Jenkins](http://theluckystrike.co.uk) about leadership, design and development. I also write for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/improving-ux-for-color-blind-users/) about UX.

## Author

I wrote a book about writing maintainable CSS called [MaintainableCSS](http://maintainablecss.com) (creative I know). Now, I am working on my [second book](/signup/) about how to design user-friendly forms on the web.
