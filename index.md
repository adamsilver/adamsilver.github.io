# Hello! My name is Adam Silver and I am a Front end developer, based in London.

What differentiates me, is that I write test-driven, object-oriented Javascript with very high quality and reliability. I have vast experience in building cross-browser, accessible and rich, progressively enhanced user interfaces. I know what works, what doesn't and what to avoid in the process from a technical and UX perspective.

I am a very experienced Agile software developer which compliments my technical skills. Having previously, acted as Scrum Master, I am adept at spotting friction within a team and will actively and passionately endeavour to 'Make the boat go faster' by unifiying and leading a team to success.

More on this soon. In the meantime, you can read my [articles](/articles/).

I am highly experienced in HTML, CSS and various ECMAScript implementations found in the browser and I will be sharing my experience and knowledge through various [articles](/articles/).

Oh and of course these bits are required... [Github](http://www.github.com/adamsilver/), [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/adambsilver/) and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/adambsilver).
