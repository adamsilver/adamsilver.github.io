# Hello! I'm Adam, a UX-driven Front-end Developer from London.

I believe that websites should be readily accessible by people &mdash; *all* people &mdash; no matter their age, ability, user interaction preferences and, choice of device, Operating System and browser.

I *also* believe that the experience can be nice for everyone, but *exceptional* for some &mdash; much like how we can watch perfectly good movies on black and white televisions &mdash; but HD televisions are that bit *nicer*!

I like to solve problems, preferably ones that are worth solving, because otherwise they are *not* problems are they?
