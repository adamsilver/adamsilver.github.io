# Hello, my name is Adam Silver, a UX engineer with over 15 years experience designing, prototyping and building human-friendly websites.

## Belief

I believe in creating amazing digital products that are [accessible](/articles/the-role-of-the-front-end-developer/#accessibility) to everyone, no matter their age, ability, choice of device or interaction preferences. We can do this by designing humanised and [simple experiences]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}) that [embrace the conventions of the web]({% post_url 2015-10-09-designing-honestly-for-the-web %}).

## Approach

I love to work together from ideation all the way through to production. My preference is to lean on Agile methodologies to help focus on the truly essential &mdash; <em>less but better</em>.

## Writing

Not only do I [write here](/articles/) but I also write on the [Simple=Human](http://medium.com/simple-human) publication with my friend [Mark Jenkins](http://theluckystrike.co.uk), which is a collection of articles written by us about leadership, design and development.
