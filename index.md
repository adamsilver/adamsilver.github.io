# Hi, I'm Adam Silver.

My mission is to enhance people's lives by designing and building [simple](/articles/embracing-simplicity/) experiences on the web.

I [write](/articles/), teach, [speak]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}) and do this pretty much on a daily basis. If you want to chat with me about any of this [send me a message](mailto:adambsilver+speaking@gmail.com).

<!--I specialise in [UX](/articles/hello-ux-designer/), [Front-end Engineering](/articles/the-role-of-the-front-end-developer/) and [Strategy](/articles/how-we-cut-our-mvp-in-half-to-launch-kidly/).
## Speaking

Sometimes I [speak at conferences]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}). If you would like me to speak at yours just [send me a message](mailto:adambsilver+speaking@gmail.com).-->
