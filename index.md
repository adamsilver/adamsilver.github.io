	<h1>I'm Adam. I can help you design and build human-friendly websites.</h1>
</div>

I believe websites should be accessible to *everyone*. Embracing the conventions of the web, leads to the best experience and happy users.

I love to work in-tandem with design from inception to production, in order to provide a humanised and *simple* experience, so that users can accomplish their task with the least amount of friction.

I will help you focus on the truly essential and to leave out the rest &mdash; *less but better*.
