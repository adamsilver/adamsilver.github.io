# Hello, my name is Adam. Iâ€™m a UX-driven Front-end Developer based in London, UK.

Websites should be accessible by all people &mdash; no matter their location, age, ability or interaction preferences. Subsequently, their choice of browser and device should be largely irrelevant &mdash; embracing the conventions of the web leads to an intuitive and delightful User Experience.

My experience, in building responsive, cross-browser (not multi-browser), accessible, rich and progressively enhanced user interfaces means I know what works, what doesn't and what to avoid in the process from a technical and UX perspective.

Having previously acted as Scrum Master, I am adept at spotting friction and will actively and passionately endeavour to *"make the boat go faster"*. I strive to help your business focus on what is truly essential and to leave out the rest &mdash; *less, but better*.
