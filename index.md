# Hello, I am Adam Silver, specialising in Engineering, UX and Strategy. I help companies and people make things simple and human. Based in London.

## Belief

I believe in creating amazing experiences on the web that are [accessible](/articles/the-role-of-the-front-end-developer/#accessibility) to everyone, no matter their age, ability, choice of device or interaction preferences. This is made possible by designing humanised and [simple experiences]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}) that [embrace the conventions of the web]({% post_url 2015-10-09-designing-honestly-for-the-web %}).

## Approach

I like solving *real* problems, working together from ideation through to production. My preference is to lean on Agile methodologies to help focus on the truly essential &mdash; <em>less but better</em>.

## Speaking

Sometimes I [speak at conferences]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}). Let me know if you want me to talk at yours by [sending me an email](mailto:adambsilver+speaking@gmail.com).

## Writing

Not only do I [write here](/articles/) but I also write on the [Simple=Human](http://medium.com/simple-human) publication with my friend [Mark Jenkins](http://theluckystrike.co.uk), which is a collection of articles written by us about leadership, design and development.

## Author

I also wrote a book about writing maintainable CSS, called [MaintainableCSS](http://maintainablecss.com) (creative I know). Go check it out.
