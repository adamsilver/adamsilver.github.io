# Hi, I'm Adam Silver.

My mission is to enhance people's lives by designing and coding [simple](/articles/embracing-simplicity/) and inclusive web experiences. I [write](/articles/), teach, [speak]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}) and do this pretty much on a daily basis. If you want to chat with me about any of this [send me a message](mailto:adam+hello@adamsilver.io).
