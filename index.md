<h2 class="intro">Hey. I'm a London-based Front-end developer &amp; UX designer with over 15 years experience designing and building human-friendly websites for everyone.</h2>

I believe websites should be accessible to *everyone*. The best experience is achieved by embracing the conventions of the web and striving to provide a humanised and simple experience.

To do this I love to work together with the right people from idea-inception to product build &amp; delivery. I will help you focus on the truly essential and to leave out the rest &mdash; *less but better*.
