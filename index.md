# Hello, I am Adam Silver and I help people and companies make the web simple and human. I specialise in [UX](/articles/hello-ux-designer/), [Front-end Engineering](/articles/the-role-of-the-front-end-developer/) and [Strategy](/articles/how-we-cut-our-mvp-in-half-to-launch-kidly/). I am based in London.

## Summary

I love to design and build delightful experiences on the web for [everyone](/articles/the-role-of-the-front-end-developer/#accessibility). This is made possible by designing humanised and [simple experiences]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}) that [embrace the web]({% post_url 2015-10-09-designing-honestly-for-the-web %}). I am at my happiest when I work alongside other people to help solve *real* problems.

## Speaking

Sometimes I [speak at conferences]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}). If you would like me to speak at yours just [send me a message](mailto:adambsilver+speaking@gmail.com).

## Writing

In addition to this blog, I write for [Simple=Human](http://medium.com/simple-human)&mdash;a Medium publication I started with my friend [Mark Jenkins](http://theluckystrike.co.uk) about leadership, design and development. I also write for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/improving-ux-for-color-blind-users/) about UX.

## Author

I wrote a book about writing maintainable CSS called [MaintainableCSS](http://maintainablecss.com) (creative I know) and I am working on my [second book](/signup/) which is all about forms.

## Interested in working with me?
