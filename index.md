# Hello, I am Adam Silver and I help people and companies make the web simple and human. I specialise in [UX](/articles/hello-ux-designer/), [Front-end Engineering](/articles/the-role-of-the-front-end-developer/) and [Strategy](/articles/how-we-cut-our-mvp-in-half-to-launch-kidly/). I am based in London.

## Belief

I believe in creating amazing experiences on the web that are [accessible](/articles/the-role-of-the-front-end-developer/#accessibility) to everyone, no matter their age, ability, choice of device or interaction preferences. This is made possible by designing humanised and [simple experiences]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}) that [embrace the conventions of the web]({% post_url 2015-10-09-designing-honestly-for-the-web %}).

## Approach

I like solving *real* problems, working together from ideation through to production. My preference is to lean on Agile methodologies to help focus on the truly essential &mdash; <em>less but better</em>.

## Speaking

Sometimes I [speak at conferences]({% post_url 2016-03-06-embracing-simplicity %}). Let me know if you want me to talk at yours by [sending me an email](mailto:adambsilver+speaking@gmail.com).

## Writing

In addition to this blog, I write for [Simple=Human](http://medium.com/simple-human)&mdash;a Medium publication I started with my friend [Mark Jenkins](http://theluckystrike.co.uk) about leadership, design and development. I also write for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/improving-ux-for-color-blind-users/) about UX.

## Author

I also wrote a book about writing maintainable CSS called [MaintainableCSS](http://maintainablecss.com) (creative I know). Go check it out.
