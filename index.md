# Hi, I'm Adam.

My mission is to enhance people's lives by designing [simple](/articles/embracing-simplicity/), human and [inclusive experiences](/articles/designing-inclusively/) on the web.

## Books

I've written a little book about maintainable css and because I'm so creative I called it [MaintainableCSS](http://maintainablecss.com) :). And I'm in the middle of writing my next book so stay tuned.

## Skills

My skills can be briefly broken down into the following:

1. **UX**&mdash;Research, user journeys, interaction design, inclusive design, prototyping, A/B testing, wireframing, responsive design, and accessibility.
2. **Front-end development**&mdash;HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jasmine, Node.js and a multitude of related technologies.
3. **Strategy**&mdash;Leading and collaborating on an iterative design and development process. Shaping a productâ€™s MVP and beyond.
