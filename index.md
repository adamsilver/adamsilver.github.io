# Hello! My name is Adam Silver and I am a Front-end Developer, based in London.

I am an *experienced* Agile front end web developer. What differentiates me, is that I write [test-driven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), high quality and *reliable*, [object-oriented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) Javascript.

My experience in building [cross-browser (not multi-browser)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-browser#Cross-browser_vs._multi-browser), [accessible](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php), rich and [progressively enhanced](http://jakearchibald.com/2013/progressive-enhancement-still-important/) user interfaces means I know what works, what doesn't and what to avoid in the process from a technical and UX perspective.

Having previously acted as Scrum Master, I am adept at spotting friction within a team and will actively and passionately endeavour to *[Make the boat go faster](http://www.willitmaketheboatgofaster.com/)* by unifying and leading a team to success.
