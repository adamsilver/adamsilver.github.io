# Hello, my name is Adam. Iâ€™m a UX developer based in London, UK.

I believe websites should be accessible to *everyone* and that embracing the conventions of the web leads to a delightful user experience.

I love to work in-tandem with design, from inception to production, in order to provide a humanised and *simple* experience, so that users can accomplish their task with the least amount of friction.

To do this I will endeavour to help your business focus on what is truly essential and to leave out all ther rest &mdash; *less, but better*.
