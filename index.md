<h1 class="intro">Hey, my name is Adam Silver, a London-based Front-end developer &amp; UX designer with over 15 years experience designing and building human-friendly websites.</h1>

<div class="belief">
	<h2>Belief &amp; approach</h2>

	<p>I believe websites should be accessible to <em>everyone</em>. The best experience is achieved by embracing the conventions of the web and striving to provide a humanised and simple experience.

	<p>I love to work together with the right people from idea-inception to product build &amp; delivery. I will help you focus on the truly essential and to leave out the rest &mdash; <em>less but better</em>.</p>
