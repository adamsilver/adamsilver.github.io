# Hello! My name is Adam Silver and I am a Front end developer, based in London.

I am an experienced Agile software developer which compliments my technical skills. What differentiates me, is that I write test-driven, high quality and reliable, object-oriented Javascript.

My experience in building cross-browser, accessible, rich and progressively enhanced user interfaces means I know what works, what doesn't and what to avoid in the process from a technical and UX perspective.

Having previously acted as Scrum Master, I am adept at spotting friction within a team and will actively and passionately endeavour to '[Make the boat go faster](http://www.willitmaketheboatgofaster.com/)' by unifying and leading a team to success.
