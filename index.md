	<h1>Hello, my name is Adam. Iâ€™m a UX driven front-end developer based in London.</h1>

I believe websites should be accessible to *everyone* and that embracing the conventions of the web leads to happy users.

I love to work in-tandem with design, from inception to production, in order to provide a humanised and *simple* experience, so that users can accomplish their task with the least amount of friction.

I will endeavour to help your business focus on what is truly essential and to leave out all the rest &mdash; *less but better*.
