Have you ever updated some CSS only to cause regression elsewhere? Have you ever inherited a large codebase and been afraid to touch it? Have you ever wanted to remove redundant code, but you just didn’t feel confident enough to do so?

*Yes?* Me too!

Wouldn’t it be nice to write and architect your styles *without* worrying about all of these things and more?

Yep&mdash;thought so!

Introducing [MaintainableCSS&mdash;an approach to writing scalable, modular, and of course maintainable CSS](http://maintainablecss.com).

Born out of experiencing all the same problems and frustrations that you have probably had, I realised that a combination of semantics and reuse (not how you might think) are reasons why we can get in a mess with CSS.

*MaintainableCSS* isn’t something you can download&mdash;it’s a very simple set of guidelines, explaining how and why you should write CSS for your project.

Give it a try (you can read and apply the principles in minutes), and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions, because I would love to hear from you.
