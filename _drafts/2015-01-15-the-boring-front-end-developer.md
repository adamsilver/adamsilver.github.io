*Cool* front-end developers are always *pushing the envelope*, jumping out of their seat to use the latest and greatest and shiniest of UI frameworks and libraries. *Cool* front-end developers are *bridging the gap* between native apps and web and so will strive to make the UI look and behave like an app. *Which app?* you may ask. *iPhone? Android? What version?* All good questions, alas another topic all together. Eerily, there is another kind of front-end developer, cannot always be found in the limelight, the *boring* front-end developer. Here is an ode to the *boring* front-end developer.

## 1. Preprocessors

When given the choice to add the latest tooling, the boring front-end developer will ask two questions: 1) Will new developers need to learn another altered language beyond the language of the web (HTML, CSS, JS) and 2) Will developers be forced to work more slowly in their debugging technique? If the answer to any of these questions is *yes* then the boring front-end developer will say no to preprocessors.

## 2. Browser support

The boring developer realises that while not all experiences will be identical and that all browsers *can* be used to consume a website, even *gasp*, IE6 and below. He will promote Progressive Enhancement and Cross-browser (not Multi- Browser) scripting at any given opportunity. The boring front-end developer realises it is not a feat to drop support for a particular (set of) browser(s) and stop caring about those users.

## 3. Accessibility

The boring developer realises that not every user is the same. Users have different abilities and preferred ways of using a computer, whether its a mouse, finger, thumb, screen reader, keyboard or a combination of all, websites should be consumable no matter the audience, screen size or capability of the browser.

## 4. UI design

The boring front-end developer embraces the constraints and limitations of the browser so that he doesn't find himself in a world of adaptive design and UA sniffing because that world is horrible, ill-advised and costly.

It is best to include him in the UX design process to save wasting time designing a UI that should be avoided or can be done more simply. See Position: fixed [0] and absuing select menus [0] for more on that.

The boring front-end developer will also suggest the use of native form controls realising that browsers will enhance the experience where possible, particularly on mobile, and doesn't try to control the look and feel too much as he knows the brand will *not* suffer for that decision.

He will boringly suggest that links are styled (with underlines) as such so that users can find them amongst normal copy.

## 5. Third party script, libraries and frameworks

The boring front-end developer carefully selects third party scripts by ensuring he does due diligence on the code itself, *not* the popularity within the industry. He favours reliability over popularity every time.

## 6. UI architecture

The boring front-end developer will adhere to the following quote by James Norton:

> As a Lead Javascript engineer I try to write as little Javascript as possible

He realises that Single Page Applications cause severe problems and that by avoiding them and leaning on the server appropriately provides a better experience and reach.

## 7. CV

The boring front-end developer will develop a site based on the context of the problem and provide a solution accordingly. He will not just use [insert buzz word here] to improve his chances of finding another job based on the current technology fad in order to increase his day rate.

Be a great developer. Be boring.
