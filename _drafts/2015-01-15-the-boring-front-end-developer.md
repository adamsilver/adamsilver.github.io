*Cool* front-end developers are always *pushing the envelope*, jumping out of their seat to use the latest and greatest and shiniest of UI frameworks and libraries. *Cool* front-end developers are *bridging the gap* between native apps and web and so will strive to make the UI look and behave like an app. *Which app?* you may ask. *iPhone? Android? What version?* All good questions, alas another topic all together. Eerily, there is another kind of front-end developer, cannot always be found in the limelight, the *boring* front-end developer. Here is an ode to the *boring* front-end developer.

## 1. Preprocessors

When given the choice to add the latest tooling, the boring front-end developer will ask two questions: 1) Will new developers need to learn another altered language beyond the language of the web (HTML, CSS, JS) and 2) Will developers be forced to work more slowly in their debugging technique? If the answer to any of these questions is *yes* then the boring front-end developer will say no to preprocessors.

## 2. Browser support

The boring developer realises that while not all experiences will be identical and that all browsers *can* be used to consume a website, even *gasp*, IE6 and below. He will promote Progressive Enhancement and Cross-browser (not Multi- Browser) scripting at any given opportunity.

## 3. Accessibility

The boring developer realises that not every user is the same. Users have different abilities and preferred ways of using a computer, whether its a mouse, finger, thumb, screen reader, keyboard or a combination of all, websites should be consumable no matter the audience, screen size or capability of the browser.

## 4. UI design

The boring front-end developer embraces the constraints and limitations of the browser so that he doesn't find himself in a world of adaptive design and UA sniffing that only causes nightmares for the development team and users.

He quickly advises the avoiding of position fixed knowing that it's notoriously got poor support that can't be detected without UA sniffing. Realising UA sniffing is the number 1 thing not to do he shreeks and cries.

The boring front-end developer will use native form elements realising that browsers will enhance the experience where possible, particularly on mobile, and doesn't try to control the look and feel too much.

The boring front-end developer that interactive websites are made of links (with underlines - accessibility, see above) and forms and doesn't mess with them and ensures these elements look as such making sites that feel intuitive to the user.

## 5. Third party script, libraries and frameworks

The boring front-end developer is constantly being bombarded with "Why invent the wheel" but in reality he is not reinventing the wheel. He is merely avoiding poorly made wheels. Questions the use of [insert new shiny framework here]. Does due diligence on any third party code

## 6. UI architecture

The boring front-end developer or lead Javascript developer leans on Javascript minimally and avoids it until it is necessary....

Let's the browser do its' thing. Navigation, caching etc. JS loading etc, HTML5 polyfills.

## 7. Misc

- Avoids the use of JS and leans on the server where possible
- Values users over buzzwords on their CV, or their own learning experience or command of day rate.
- Promotes simplicity to their product owner and UX experts
- Listens to the least popular experts.
- Script loading
- Native form and branding won't be harmed
- even gasp

Be a great developer. Be boring.
