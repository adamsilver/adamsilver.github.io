*Hip* front-end developers are always pushing the envelope, embracing the latest, greatest and shiniest of frameworks and libraries. Cool front-end developers are more than happy to be making websites look and behave like an app. "Which app?" you may ask. iPhone? Android? What version? All good questions, alas this is another topic all together. There is another breed of front-end developer. Not all are cool or hip. Some front-end developers are *boring* and here is an ode to the boring front-end developer.



## 1. Preprocessors

LESS, Coffeescript

## 2. Browser support

Cares about all browsers, even Internet Explorer 6

## 3. Accessibility

Cares about users that don't own a 23inch thunderbolt screen with latest and greatest spec. Prog enhan

## 4. UI design

Forms, position fixed. Shows content instead of hiding it with fancy tabs and togglers. Doesn't get bored with paridgm of the web. Will make a website look like a website. Will embrace the native form elements. Will underline links so that users can spot and interact with them.

## 5. Third party script, libraries and frameworks

Questions the use of [insert new shiny framework here]. Does due diligence on any third party code

## 6. UI architecture

Let's the browser do its' thing. Navigation, caching etc.

## 7. Misc

- Avoids the use of JS and leans on the server where possible
- Values users over buzzwords on their CV, or their own learning experience or command of day rate.
- Promotes simplicity to their product owner and UX experts
- Listens to the least popular experts.
