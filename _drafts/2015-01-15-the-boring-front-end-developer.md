*Cool* front-end developers are always *pushing the envelope*, jumping out of their seat to use the latest and greatest and shiniest of UI frameworks and libraries. *Cool* front-end developers are *bridging the gap* between native apps and web and so will strive to make the UI look and behave like an app. *Which app?* you may ask. *iPhone? Android? What version?* All good questions, alas another topic all together. Eerily, there is another kind of front-end developer, they cannot always be found in the limelight, the *boring* front-end developer. Here is an ode to the *boring* front-end developer, *BFED* if you will.

## Preprocessors

When given the choice to add preprocessor to the technology stack, the BFED will ask two questions: 1) Will new developers need to learn another altered language beyond the language of the web (HTML, CSS, JS) and 2) Will developers be forced to work more slowly in their debugging technique? If the answer to any of these questions is *yes* then the BFED will say *no* to preprocessors.

## Browser support

The BFED realises that while not all experiences will be identical and that all browsers *can* be used to consume a website, even *gasp*, IE6 and below. The BFED will promote Progressive Enhancement and Cross-browser (not Multi-browser) scripting at any given opportunity. The BFED also realises it is not a feat to drop support for a particular (set of) browser(s) and understands that forgetting about the existence of those users hurts them and the company's perception.

## Accessibility

The BFED realises that users have different abilities and preferred ways of using a computer, whether its a mouse, finger, thumb, screen reader, keyboard or a combination of all, websites should be consumable no matter the audience, screen size or capability of the browser.

## UI design

The BFED embraces the constraints and limitations of the browser so that he doesn't find himself in a world of Adaptive Design and UA sniffing because that world is horrible, ill-advised and costly.

It is best to include the BFED in the UX design process to save wasting time designing a UI that should be avoided or can be done more simply. See [Position Fixed](/) and [Abusing Select Menus](/) for more on that.

The BFED will also suggest the use of native form controls realising that browsers will enhance the experience where possible, particularly on mobile, and doesn't try to control the look and feel too much as it is he/she knows that the brand will *not* suffer because of that decision.

The BFED will also suggest that links are styled as such, and with underlines so that users can find them amongst normal copy, sometimes to the disgust of the designer who thinks they are ugly.

## Third party CSS and Javascript libraries and frameworks

The BFED will carefully select third party code based on the quality of the code itself, *not* based on the popularity of said code. He/she favours reliability over popularity every time.

## UI architecture

The BFED will adhere to the following quote by James Norton:

> As a Lead Javascript engineer I try to write as little Javascript as possible

The BFED realises that Single Page Applications cause severe problems and that by avoiding them and leaning on the server appropriately provides a better experience and reach.

## CV

The BFED will develop a site based on the context of the problem and provide a solution accordingly. He/she will not just use [insert buzz word here] to improve his/her chances of finding another job based on the current technology fad in order to increase their day rate.

## Conclusion

Be a great front-end developer. Be boring.
