## Do

* Put the candidate at ease as much as you can. Candidates are people and they're probably nervous, stressed and tired. Calm candidates will show you their best.
* Pair with the candidate. That way you're a team just like you would be on the job.
* Give candidates a test that reflects the skills they actually need for the job.
* Be clear to the developer what they'll be tested on. Accessibility or JS or a mixture. Design the interview to encapsulate the things you're looking for.
* Adjust your interview to the level you require. If someone comes across like a know-it-all, ask harder questions.

## Don't

* Ask about one specific API. The candidate might not know that one.
* Ask for backend development knowledge unless you're hiring a full stack developer.
* Expect candidates to do a lot of work in their own time. You should give up your time equally. Respect each other's time.
* Make candidates come into your office twice. Wastes their time and yours; and it increases the chance they'll find another job inbetween time.
* Expect candidates not to use Google. They'd have it on the job so give it to them in the interview.
