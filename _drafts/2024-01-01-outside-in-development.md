## Intro

* As a front-end developer I sit in-between UX/product and back-end developers.

* This means that I do what I do because the user requires the feature.

* The backend developers do what they do because it is a requirement of the front-end developer, which in turn is because the user requires the feature. i.e. product defined the requirement. For example, the backend developer will provide the view template with an appropriate fit-for-purpose view model because that is how the page is designed.

* Depending on architecture the backend developers will push their requirements back to a DB engineer or an API engineer and so forth.

## Example

* Take Amazon, with a shopping basket page. Elaborate on the requirement and how it drives the design.

## Summary

* Business is the slave to the user
* UX/Product is slave to the Business
* Front-end is slave to the UX/Product
* Back-end is slave to the front-end
* APIs are slave to the back-end
* Etc
