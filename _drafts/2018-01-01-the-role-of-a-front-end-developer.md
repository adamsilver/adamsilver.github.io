## User Experience

Everyone is responsible for User Experience (UX) [0] and Front-end Developers play an essential role [1]. This is because due to the nature of their job they are likely to have a very deep understanding of the the browser.

Having to develop against an almost infinite amount of different browsers across different Operating Systems and devices, with different configurations means a Front-end developer truly understands the constraints of the web and embraces them to the users advantages.

## Front-end architecture

A front-end developer should design a suitable front-end architecture which considers many facets including but not limited to:

* Design patterns
* Architectural patterns
* Bootstrapping strategy
* Bundling and compression
* Modularity and semantics
* Technical contracts between back-end and front-end requests/responses.
* Code style and convention

## Front-end features

Having a defined architecutre, that architecutre can now be used to define and create features. This will include writing HTML, CSS and Javscript that pertains to existing or new features. This should include writing unit tests and (helping to) write functional tests to ensure code-qaulity is high  [X](look up a reasons to unit and functional test automation)

## Accessibility

The beauty of the web is in the deploy once, run anywhere. Two requirements: a browser and an Internet connection. Front-end developers are responsible and (should) take pride in the fact that the UIs they build are accessible to all no matter of their age, ability, user interaction preferences, device and Operating system, choice of browser etc.

## Search Engine Optimisation

Web ages should be search engine friendly and front-end developers are responsible for writing code that is friendly and accessibile to search engines so that the appropriate indexing can take place.

## Front-end performance

This includes browser caching, bundling, compression, runtime performance, build-time performance etc.

## Browser compatibility

Front-end devs should endeavour to test in as many browsers as is reasonable when developing but will understand there is a balancing act. For example feds will learn that testing in Chrome 90% of the time means Firefox will be fine so can reduce 2 browsers to one.
