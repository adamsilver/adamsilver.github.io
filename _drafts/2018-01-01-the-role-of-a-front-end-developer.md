The role of a Front-end developer has grown significantly over the years and responsiblities extend far beyond translating designs into code. A Front-end developer should be involved in many other aspects of the design and development process.

## User Experience (UX)

Everyone is responsible for UX [0] and Front-end Developers play an essential role [1]. Due to the nature of their job, they should understand the platform better than anyone else. Having to develop for a huge range of browsers across different Operating Systems and devices with different configurations means a Front-end developer truly understands the constraints of the web and embraces them to the users' advantage. This input is vital for creating a positive UX.

## Front end architecture

A front-end developer should design a suitable front-end architecture which includes:

* Design patterns
* Architectural patterns
* Bootstrapping strategies
* Bundling and compression
* Modularity and semantics
* Technical contracts between back-end and front-end (requests/responses).
* Code style and convention
* Testing and automation

## Accessibility

The beauty of the web is one of reach; deploy once, run anywhere. There are just two requirements: a browser and an Internet connection. Front-end developers are responsible and should take pride in the fact that, the UIs they build are accessible to everyone, no matter their age, ability, user interaction preferences and, choice of device, Operating System and browser. Front-end developers are normally the only advocates of accessibility and as accessibility *is* usability, it's a vital role.

## Front-end feature writing

Having defined a suitable Front-end architecture, adding new features and updating existing features will include the writing of HTML, CSS and Javscript. This should include writing unit tests and (helping to) write functional tests.

## Search Engine Optimisation

Much like Accessibility, it is imperative Front-end developers understand how to build web pages that are search-engine friendly, so that appropriate indexing can take place in order to surface the content of the web page to their users.

## Front-end performance

It is important Front-end developers understand various facets of performance ensuring that web pages are served and run as fast as possible without degrading the experience. This includes a good knowledge of browser caching, compression, bundling and runtime performance on the client.

## Browser compatibility

Front-end developers should endeavour to test in as many browsers as is reasonable when developing, but will understand there is a balance to be had, as testing all browsers, in all compatibilities, on all devices is a sisyphean task. The balance can only be struck through experience of knowing which spread of browsers should be tested and at which frequency. Leaning on cross-browser scripting [2] minimises the worry behind a lack of manual browser testing coverage.
