## User Experience

Everyone is responsible for User Experience (UX) [0] and Front-end Developers play an essential role [1]. This is because due to the nature of their job they are likely to have a very deep understanding of the the browser.

Having to develop against an almost infinite amount of different browsers, across different Operating Systems and devices, and with different configurations, means a Front-end developer truly understands the constraints of the web and embraces them to the users advantages.

## Front-end architecture

A front-end developer should design a suitable front-end architecture which considers many different aspects including but not limited to:

* Design patterns
* Architectural patterns
* Bootstrapping strategies
* Bundling and compression
* Modularity and semantics
* Technical contracts between back-end and front-end (requests/responses).
* Code style and convention
* Testing and automation

## Accessibility

The beauty of the web is that you deploy once, and can consume anywhere. There are just two requirements: a browser and an Internet connection. Front-end developers are responsible and (should) take pride in the fact that the UIs they build are accessible to all, no matter of their age, ability, user interaction preferences, device and Operating system and choice of browser etc. Front-end developers are normally the only advocates of accessibility and as accessibility *is* usability, it's a very important role.

## Front-end features

Having defined a suitable Front-end architecture, adding new features and updating existing features will include the writing of HTML, CSS and Javscript. This should include writing unit tests and (helping to) write functional tests to ensure code-qaulity is high  [X](look up a reasons to unit and functional test automation).

## Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

Front-end developers should have a thorough knowledge in organic SEO so that they are writing code that is accessibile to search engines.

## Front-end performance

Front-end developers should have a deep understanding of how to produce performant UIs which includes various aspects such as browser caching, bundling, compression, runtime performance and build-time performance.

## Browser compatibility

Front-end developers should endeavour to test in as many browsers as is reasonable when developing but will understand there is a balancing act. For example they will learn that testing in Chrome 90% of the time means Firefox will be fine so can reduce 2 browsers to one for the majority of their development. Ensuring they lean on Cross-browser techniques [0] limits the worry to test in every browser known to man.
