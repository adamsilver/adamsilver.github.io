The role of a Front-end developer has grown significantly over the years and responsiblities extend far beyond translating designs into code. An experienced Front-end developer should be involved in many other aspects of the design and development process which this article addresses.

## User Experience

Everyone is responsible for User Experience (UX) [0] and Front-end Developers play an essential role [1]. This is because due to the nature of their job they (should) understand the platform better than anyone else. Having to develop against an almost infinite amount of different browsers across different Operating Systems and devices with different configurations means a Front-end developer truly understands the constraints of the web and embraces them to the users' advantage.

## Front end architecture

Ensures that a suitable front-end architecture and codebase is designed appropriately considering design patterns (such as constructors), architectural patterns (such as MVC), bootstrapping techniques, bundling and compression, modularity and semantics. Technical contracts should be in-place between the front-end and backend developers to discuss appropriate view-models for the view template engine and XHR request and response formats.

## Front end features

Includes writing HTML, CSS and Javscript that pertains to existing or new features. Should include writing unit tests, where appropriate and (helping to) write functional tests to ensure code-qaulity is high [[X](look up a reasons to unit and functional test automation)]

## Accessibility

The beauty of the web is one of reach; deploy once, run anywhere. There are just two requirements: a browser and an Internet connection. Front-end developers are responsible and (should) take pride in the fact that the UIs they build are accessible to everyone, no matter their age, ability, user interaction preferences or choice of device, Operating System, and browser.

## Search Engine Optimisation

Much like Accessibility, it is imperative Front-end developers understand how to build web pages that are search-engine friendly, so that appropriate indexing can take place in order to surface the content of the web page to their users.

## Front-end performance

It is important Front-end developers understand various facets of performance ensuring that web pages are served and run as fast as possible without degrading the experience. This includes expert understanding of browser caching, compression and bundling and runtime performance on the client.

## Browser compatibility

Front-end developers should endeavour to test in as many browsers as is reasonable when developing but will understand there is a balance to be had, as testing all browsers, in all compatibilities, on all devices is a sisyphean task. The balance can only be struck through experience of knowing which spread of browsers should be tested and at which frequency. Leaning on feature-detection and testing minimises the worry behind lack of browser testing coverage.
