* Learned behaviour

* Buttons looking like links

* Links looking like buttons (See github issue page)

* http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/3788/default-cursor-on-mouse-over-of-a-button-is-not-a-hand-pointer

* Only links have cursor: pointer - giving me an indication i can open in new window, or tab, or save bookmark, or share to twitter or whatever - buttons can't do that and so shouldn't pretend with the subtly of a cursor change that matches links.
