Technical Wanking is unfortunately not a term I coined myself. That has to be credited to James Norton, a fantastic Front-end Developer with a tendency to tell it how it is. A good number of years ago, I was building my first Single Page Application and I just felt so good. I was using the latest greatest libraries and frameworks and pushing the (read a) browser to it's limit. Up until this moment I just read lots of shiny blog posts and could only dream of using these things. I felt so clever, and I thought it was great for my CV.

Then, James joined the company, and he pointed out how amazing the app could have been if it was a normal thin client application. He pointed out so many problems that were all self-induced. When I am questioned like this, I tend think deeply about the feedback. I could totally see what he was saying, I didn't brush it off as such, but I was 6 months into the project and as I only had to support Chrome, it didn't bother me too much. At least I was learning and adding all these fantastic buzzwords to my CV.

It was also during this conversation, that James chose to tell me that I was Technical Wanking. I laughed and continued to listen. He told me that I was so focused on using all the latest greatest tech, which added tremendous effort to the build and that he was dubious of the benefits both in terms of performance and User Experience, not to mention Accessibility.

I analysed all this for ages, I thought about it **a lot**. I realisd he was so right. Over the course of the project I did my absolute best to deliver a quality product. I dreamt about how to deliver a very complex Single Page Application problem to do with view rendering. It was a beast, and I solved it. The problem was that I was solving a self-induced problem. Why did I do that. I was blind. But now I could see (again). Before the shiny shit came along, I always built robust, rich and far reaching websites. That was the purpose of my job. When did it change?

I really learnt my lesson, and I began to look deeper at it all. I began to question it all. Afterall, I don't like to be called a Technical Wanker do I? Also if everyone's doing it then it's usually a sign it's no good. McDonalds is a good indicator. McDonalds is the best, everyone's doing it. But, it's terrible for you. In this industry the same applies, just exchange McDonalds for technology and architectural choices.

So two things have happened since this realisation. 1) I stopped wanking. I mean I stopped *Technical Wanking*. 2) I have taken every opportunity to use this term as if I coined it myself. It always gets a good laugh and a positive, inquisitive response. Most people take kindly to it.

The problem with the industry is that most people are Technical Wankers; it's an epidemic. I am doing my best here to not name the JS and CSS frameworks which promise the world but have fragile code under the hood and rarely serve the end user unless they have a particular browser, on the latest greatest device, with Javascript turned well and truly on, and on a standard Internet connection; definitely not a telco that might eat your script. And breath.

If you're here reading this, and your head isn't stuck up your ass, you're very likely to know the stuff I am talking about, and with a bit of luck, the fad will pass. However, when one fad passes, a new one comes a long and the industry continues to waste a load of money on the next great rewrite.

Needless, to say 

<!--
I suppose Technical Wanking is the arch-enemy of [The Boring Front-end Developer](/articles/the-boring-front-end-developer/) and I guess this is the "I call bullshit" version of that article, at least in terms of Front-end. There is nothing wrong with abstractions. Anyone who writes the same code more than once, abstracts and automates. You might call a group of abstractions a library. And that's just fine. You might call a set of conventions, configuration and style a framework. That's also fine.

But, and it's a big but, there is a difference between abstractions in general, and abstractions that are failing on release due to poor code quality, complexity and in this industry specifically, browser support! Unfortunately, there is normally very little attempt to put the user first. A lot of these librarys are selling themselves to developers; write less, don't reinvent the wheel etc. It's rarely about the user, browser support and reach.

Avoiding the shinier Front-end libraries and co, have given 

* the best thing to come out of all this was 1) realising technical wanking is a thing and 2) I was doing it.
