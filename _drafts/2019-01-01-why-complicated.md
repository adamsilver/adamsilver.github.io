At school, we're taught to be cleverer.

At school they teach u to advance ur vocab. Using a thesaurus gets you bonus points.

More interestingly though is *why* do we do this. As I have an unhealthy obsession for simplicity, I've managed to research and consciously observe people practicing the are of complicating things. Here's some notes on the matter:

1. We, people that is, have a complex about doing more. Mark Jenkins wrote an article about two different designers and how their approach and the resulting contribution sets them apart. In short, we as humans always want to do more and we worry about our own contribution. The more we contribute the better we feel. But this is often counterproductive.

2. Greg McKeown talks about how success often breed failure because with success comes growth. With growth comes more opportunity, more departments, more people trying to contribute (see previous point). This manifests itself in different departments (marketing, digital, merchandising) vying for space on different parts of a website. Inevitably stuff gets added and pages get bloated.

3. We often think that people care about our product as much as we do. We get emotionally invested in the products we design. But most people don't care about our site like we do. They don't come for entertainment. They just want the outcome. So *we* get bored and *we* add more stuff. In many respects we come up with problems to solve.

4. More specifically related to this topic is that we think all users must complete tasks within 3 clicks[^] which is a gigantic UX myth. It's not about clicks (or pages), it's about users making their way through a process as quickly and as easily as possible.

5. We often confuse simplicity for having *one* of something[^]. But that's not necessarily true. Having one of something that is intertwined with many things is far from simple.

6. And lastly, we often assume that our users are the same as us. We think they have the same cutting edge devices and the same expensive data contracts. But actually they don't[^West].

Whatever the reason, we end up having to come up with clever ways to make slow pages faster. It's like eating donuts ever day, putting on five stone in weight, and then coming up with innovative ways to make a fat man run fast. I'm thinking rocket boots, do you have any better ideas?

*Innovation* by the way is a dirty word. Most often, it's seen as a license to spend a lot of time solving problems that are typically introduced by the same person trying to solve them.
