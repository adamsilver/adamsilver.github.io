Let's chat: What are the most important or most forgotten things when it comes to inclusive web design? #UX #a11y

1. Dyslexic users

2. Iliterate users

3. Font-size

4. Small touch targets

5. Thinking that mobile == touch and big screens = desktop

6. Long paragraphs

7. Assumption of device, browser, connection speed

8. Using background images to achieve design without text i.e won't work if you disable images and/or css

9. Videos without transcripts

10. Missing labels i.e. search form

11. Error messages not read out by screen readers

12. No fallback (everyone has js)

13. Contrast

14. Keyboard focus/active states

15. Not relying on the browser for loading indicators i.e. page refresh, trying to cram everything into a single document, killing the back button.

16. Disabling zoom

17. Breaking the inherent resilience in the web (motherfucking) and my PE article

18. Designing for yourself, not for your users

19. Designing for best case examples, short names

20. Not placing enough effort on human friendly copy

21. Getting in the users way too early, hand holding i.e. form hints

22. Relying on placeholders instead of labels

23. Meaningful link text - still so much click here, read more.

24. Chucking a load of JS/CSs frameworks blindly eating up memory/battery power for situations that aren't relevant to the context of the problem

25. Not using forms for forms, and links for links.

26. Placing visual design above functionality, inclusivity and accessibility for all.

27. Trying to destroy user agent browser/device/os specific useful styles. Such as outline (without replacing appropriately or leaving alone). Cursor: pointer/hand.

28. Desiging for the business, not the for the user.

29. Hiding content, when it's simpler to just reveal it.
