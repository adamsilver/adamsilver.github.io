Designers often want to control every aspect (read pixel) of the UI to the extent that everything looks identical on all browsers. You will notice that form controls look significantly different across browsers [[0](#ref0)] and because of this, *custom* form controls cause periodic discussions between developers and designers. Form controls, unlike most other HTML elements, are nigh on impossible to style consistently Cross-browser. Roger Johansson says:

> "...it shows that using CSS to style form controls to look exactly the same across browsers and platforms is impossible. It also shows that most browsers ignore many CSS properties when they are applied to form controls."

Some elements are more problematic than others. When developers endeavour to tame these elements, user experience is often degraded, which is normally the reason for attempting this feat in the first place.

## Users don't notice the difference

**Question:** Should websites (read form controls) look the same in every browser? <br>**Answer:** No [[1](#ref1)].

And Nicholas Zakas beautifully points out why in *Progresssive Enhancement 2.0* [[2](#ref2)]. You can go straight to 16 minutes in to skip the history lesson, although that is also very informative.

Your users aren't noticing pixel differences, and they aren't noticing that form controls are slightly different on their iPhone (for example) compared to their favourite desktop browser, and, even if they are, they don't care. It's not going to stop them using your site, consuming content and purchasing items etc.

**Please don't take this article to mean we should be uneccessarily sloppy translating designs into living websites! We as developers should strive for quality and consistency when translating designs.**

It is arguably positive that browsers show these things differently as they match the native OS, and because a user uses the same browser repeatedly, there is an inherent expectation of how form controls look and behave in *that* browser.

The only people who look at websites in multiple browsers are Front-end Developers, not users.

## "Solutions" result in a degraded experience

For example, on some devices, when the user activates a Select control, the browser will show a native popup [[3](#ref3)]. This makes it easier to use. However, users forgo this behaviour if the control is customised with Javascript.

There are examples of such scripts, just Google "select replacement javascript". Try running them on an iPhone for example and notice the browser doesn't show the popup, leaving the user to pinch and zoom, making it harder to use. The behaviour is now different to all other websites who utilise native select controls. Typically these scripts don't support all browsers. Why would you want to even risk it just for a slight improvement in asthetics?

Attempting to tame form controls induces significant development effort which most certainly results in code bloat, bugs, and as has been described earlier, a degraded experience for at least some users, in at least some browsers. As Garrett Dimon says:

> There are many things worth investing time to develop and implement. Customising the look and feel of form fields is absolutely not one of them. This is especially true if the method involves JavaScript to change the appearance. Browser form fields may not be the prettiest things in the world, but people are used to and comfortable with them. Itâ€™s not surprising that the sites I come across with custom-designed forms often have significant usability problems.

## Summary

As an experienced Front-end Developer, it is important to know what works and what doesn't, and styling form controls to this extent is the latter. Some browsers are more friendly than others, but if you can't control them in a reliable, consistent way, *without* hurting the user experience, then it is not compelling to try in the name of *aesthetics* or *branding*. On the other hand this article demonstrates (just some of the) good reasons *not* to. There are much more pressing matters requiring development and design effort. The web (and its constraints) just like any other platform, must be embraced.
