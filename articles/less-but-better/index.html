			<h1>Less but better</h1>
	        <p>There are times in life when you learn something new — a moment that sets you off down a different path. Maybe you always had it “in” you, but something triggered it. Maybe it was a culmination of things or maybe something else entirely.</p>

<p>I think it happened to me when I was working with <a href="http://theluckystrike.co.uk/">Mark
Jenkins</a> in the UX team at <a href="http://just-eat.co.uk/">Just
Eat</a> back in 2014. But, before I tell you what happened, I want to set the scene a little bit.</p>

<p>They say 3 of the hardest things to deal with in life are: having a child,
refurbishing a house and moving job. Well, the hero I am (LOL), I did all three at the same time.</p>

<p>And whilst it was my choice to do the first two, the third wasn’t. They let me go and whilst that can happen as part of being a contractor it wasn’t part of the “plan”.</p>

<p>Doing one thing is hard enough but doing three is not the way to do something well or stress-free. If, for example, I just had the new job, it would have been far easier to deal with.</p>

<p>So I moved on and sorted myself out with a new six-month contract at Just Eat. And that is when I met Mark, a UX designer.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for me to realise how awesome he was. I am not one of those guys who says everything is “awesome”. Mark though, was and is, awesome.</p>

<p>We talked about some of the troubles that Just Eat had. How we hoped we could help the team make things better. In terms of UX, front-end and the time it takes to release — just to name a few.</p>

<p>It’s not only Just Eat — most companies, teams and products have problems.
In-fact, they have problems because of their huge success.</p>

<p>Success can breed failure because success breeds growth. And when a company
grows, there is just <em>more</em> of everything — more people and more opportunities to spend your attention on.</p>

<p>Mark and I spent a lot of time discussing these things. Then, one day he gave me this book: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0753555166/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0753555166&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adamsilverio-21">Essentialism: The disciplined pursuit of
less</a>. He said “read this, you’ll love it.”</p>

<p>I did love it.</p>

<p>It was the idea that doing less is far more productive than doing more. The idea that you can do less, but better.</p>

<p>Problem is, it seems as though people are hard-wired with a do-more mindset.</p>

<p>I see it all the time in our industry. They design solutions for problems that don’t exist. They make something far more complicated than needed. They do a whole bunch of stuff that adds little or no value.</p>

<p>People think you’re mad if you say you want less stuff . In-fact the American Dream revolves around the idea that more is better — but that
<a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/dream/">story</a> is for another day.</p>

<p>When you do more, there is a tendency to do even more after that. It’s habit
forming.</p>

<p>And I am not just talking about design. I am talking about <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>Whether you’re designing, coding, or managing product scope, make the next smallest improvement. Then get feedback. Do just what you need to do and no more than that.</p>

<p><strong>Narrow your focus and do it better.</strong></p>

<p>In software engineering, they call it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>.</p>

<p>In product management, they call it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.</p>

<p>In Agile they call it <a href="https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/continuous-improvement/">continuous
improvement</a>.</p>

<p>In reality all this — everything — is design. Whether you’re designing a
product, a process or even your life, it’s all design.</p>

<p>Coding up a UI component? Just build it and worry about abstraction later. Once you’ve learned more about what’s worth abstracting.</p>

<p>Facilitating and managing the delivery process? Add just as much process as you need and no more. Ask your team how it went. And improve.</p>

<p>Enhancing something with Javascript? Build the degraded version first and see if it’s good enough. You might surprise yourself.</p>

<p>Living life? Try and <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/the-1-rule-for-creating-all-habits-53aa3f10bc5d#.8n48coaus">improve something small just 1% per
day</a>.</p>

<p>People get excited by more. People get excited by complexity. People get excited by the idea that something can be perfect but there is no such thing.</p>

<p><em>Done</em> is better than perfect.</p>

<p>I get excited by doing something that didn’t need complexity. That didn’t need more. That <em>less</em> was enough, that <em>less</em> was <em>better</em>.</p>

<p>It’s a constant practice, a habit to form, a mindset to nurture.</p>

<p>The trick is to practice continuous improvement.</p>

<p>Then after you’re done you can <em>iterate</em>. The next smallest improvement creates momentum. Then you’re done again.</p>

<p>Then you’re in a flow of done.</p>

<p>Then you’re in a flow of learning (from users).</p>

<p>Then you’ve achieved momentum.</p>

<p>Then it’s just the way you do things.</p>

<p>The users might be your team members following a process.</p>

<p>They might be your fellow developers trying to use your code.</p>

<p>And, of course, people using your product.</p>

<p>When you do more, you spread yourself thinly. You widen your focus and you do it all to a lesser standard. You learn fewer things, over a longer period of time and get stressed. That’s not a recipe for success.</p>

<p>Anyway, this email is my MVP. Time to press send.</p>

<p>If you unsubscribe, that’s okay. For one I got it done. For two I can learn to iterate and write you a better email next time.</p>
