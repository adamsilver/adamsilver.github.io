			<h1>Don't use AJAX for personalised content</h1>
	        <p>You may be trying to reduce page-load time by using <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/stuff/Caching/Content_Caching.html">content caching</a> to improve UX.</p>

<p>If your page contains personalised content this technique doesn’t work. This is because one user may receive another user’s personalised content. This is obviously dangerous and no good.</p>

<p>Next, somebody says we should use AJAX to pull in the personalised content. This is problematic for many reasons. Before discussing them, let’s first discuss exactly what personalised content is.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-personalised-content">What is personalised content?</h2>

<p>Personalised content is content that is specific to a user. The most basic example would be a “Logout” link. This is because the page knows that <em>you</em> are logged in and that <em>you</em> may want to logout.</p>

<p>Even though this is personal, this can be cached because you can group users into two buckets: logged out users and logged in users. So you can serve the correct cached page to each bucket.</p>

<p>Personalised content that can’t be cached is content that is unique to a specific user. For example, a users name or the contents of their shopping basket.</p>

<p>Okay, so now we’ve cleared that up. What’s the problem with using AJAX to load in personalised content?</p>

<h2 id="the-architecture-becomes-complex">1. The architecture becomes complex</h2>

<p>What seems like a simple use of AJAX has a significant effect on architecture.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is there one extra request for personalised content or multiple?</li>
  <li>Do you serve it as JSON and then parse that on the client?</li>
  <li>How do you organise your scripts for this?</li>
  <li>How do you organise the view partials for this on the server?</li>
  <li>At what point is personalised content not essential to the UX and how does that affect architecture?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-people-will-have-a-broken-experience">2. Some people will have a broken experience</h2>

<p>If the user doesn’t have Javascript (and there are <a href="http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html">many reasons why they won’t</a>), then they’ll get an incomplete and broken web page. Not being able to logout, or not being able to see their basket equates to a broken experience.</p>

<p>This goes against Progressive Enhancement which in-turn goes against the spirit of the web. We shouldn’t unnecessarily exclude people.</p>

<h2 id="replacing-browser-behaviour-degrades-the-experience">3. Replacing browser behaviour degrades the experience</h2>

<p>When we use AJAX to load in content, we stop using the inherent functionality browsers provide for free. This functionality is an intuitive aspect of the browsing experience.</p>

<p>This includes displaying a loading indicator that accurately indicates the progress of the request. It also includes handling response and timeout errors.</p>

<p>Using AJAX and content-caching like this, means at first the page is only half rendered. Then, sometime later, the personalised content is injected into the page. This will be at least a little bit jarring as the page fills in the gaps.</p>

<p>You’ll need to implement loading spinners, and hide content, and show the content perhaps with a transition. These things are rarely smooth and they differ from site to site. All of which does not help the user.</p>

<p>Sometimes the second request might finish after the user has scrolled down the page and started interacting. This means the user may not notice this new personalised content.</p>

<h2 id="extra-work-is-needed">4. Extra work is needed</h2>

<p>First, a designed needs to provide a loading indicator. Then they might need to design transitions.</p>

<p>Second, developers will need to implement this functionality and ensure this content is accessible to screen readers.</p>

<p>Third testers will need to test all this and using AJAX makes functional tests harder to write.</p>

<h2 id="performance-actually-degrades">5. Performance actually degrades</h2>

<p>Instead of a single HTTP request that contains the whole response there will now be multiple. The first would be for the Document containing non-personalised content. The subsequent request will be via AJAX and <em>will</em> hit your web server, therefore subject to the same latency as always.</p>

<p>And any performance increase is negated by the extra JS and CSS which needs to download and execute (reflows and repaints) in the browser. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making a JSON request;</li>
  <li>parsing the response;</li>
  <li>handling errors;</li>
  <li>finding elements;</li>
  <li>traversing the Document tree;</li>
  <li>updating the Document; and</li>
  <li>loading spinners and whatever else.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Content-caching <em>is</em> a very useful technique when used responsibly and for pages that don’t contain personalised content. For pages that <em>do</em> contain personalised content, a <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2014/05/and-you-thought-your-page-could-not-be-cached.html">cookie check can determine whether the cached version should be served or not</a>.</p>

<p>It is ill-advised to misuse Javascript in this way as there are several negative side effects in doing so. AJAX should not break the web, it should enhance the experience where necessary.</p>

<p>AJAX seems like an innocent and beneficial solution, but in reality it encourages bad practice that creates several self-induced problems for users and the development team.</p>

* http://itamarst.org/writings/dynamiccaching.html
* cache invalidated means it goes to server anyway

## Comment from blog covers it off:

> I think this would be a useful technique in only special situations. It does accomplish what you want but will require multiple downloads and will make a portion of your page unaccessible to those who have disabled JS (from what I have heard that is 10% of the intenet population).

> Plus I am dubious of the savings. The reason for the caching to not have a web brower contact the website. It can just retrieve the content from cache. But if it is having to retrieve a portion of the content anyway you still have to make a HTTP request. Might as well make that response a bit bigger and get rid of the multiple requests and more complex code.

> Sounds to me like this is going a little overboard on caching. Some pages are just not designed for caching. If that is the case then implement your application to use the “If-Modified-Since” header. That way the user can make their request but get back a small response in most cases.

> I think this is premature optimization.
