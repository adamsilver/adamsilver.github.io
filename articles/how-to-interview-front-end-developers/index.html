    <p>Pair</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t ask a one of specific question about one particular API</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide a reasonable tech test that actually relates to the skillset you need on your team</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be careful what questions you ask</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t ask for backend development knowledge in detail unless you are hiring for a full stack developer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t expect them to do a lot of work in their spare time for the job. You need to give up your time equally. Good developers are sought after. Respect each others time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t make them come in twice. Wastes there time, and yours and increases the chance they will find another job inbetween int1 and int2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DOnt expect the candidates not to have access to google or libraries but it is really important to understand what knowledge they have without google or libraries as to ascertain they are what you need.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be clear to the developer what it is they are to be tested on. Accessibility or js, or a mixture. Devise a test that encapsulates all the things you are looking for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your hirign a front end dev dont test a generic computer science/problem solving test as this is not what they will be doing? If it is then u possibly dont want a front end developer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put the developer at ease as much as you can. Sometimes developers want it so bad they mess up, even when they are perfectly capable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adjust your interview to the level you require. If someone comes across like a know it all I will ask penetrating questions etc.</p>
