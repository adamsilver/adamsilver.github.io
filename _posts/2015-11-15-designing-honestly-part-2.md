One experience I have of this is when I worked at a *very* successful e-commerce company.

They wanted to give their users the ability to pay for their order using PayPal.

Just as we were about to start development the business blocked it. This was the design that got blocked:

<div class="image">
	<img src="/assets/img/paymentchoice.png" alt="Payment choice page" width="371">
</div>

It was blocked because it was too easy to select PayPal.

**(You read that correctly.)**

The reason stemmed from the fact that when our users paid using card we received 50p per order as a transaction fee. With PayPal we wouldn't.

50p is a lot to lose when you're taking approximately 750,000 orders per week.

The proposed solution to the "problem" was to hide PayPal behind some sort of expand/collapse panel.

The goal of course, was to make something so hard to find and use, that users didn't bother with it and therefore continue to use Card.

Which begs the question *why add PayPal at all*?

We knew that our users *wanted* PayPal and there are many people that *only* shop with PayPal for both security and convenience reasons.

There are many reasons why people drop off during checkout, which costs the business a lot more than 50p per order, considering the average order value was around £20.00.

## What would happen if we added PayPal as originally designed?

I can’t know for sure, but this is what I think:

1. A small percentage of existing users would have started using PayPal.
* We would have attracted new users because we now offer PayPal.

Even if as much as say 25% of users (which is unlikely) stopped paying the 50p, it is highly likely they would be happier for using PayPal as a more convenient, and perceptively more secure option.

A happy user is one that purchases more frequently or at least continues to use the service at the same frequency.

A happy user also has the potential to recommend to friends or family&mdash;how much is that worth in marketing?

Bare in mind that mid-to-late adopters need a bit of a nudge before they make the jump. PayPal could provide a welcome tipping point to attract new users.

And, if our competitors offered PayPal, users may decide to jump ship.

**So to sum up: keep users happy + attract new users = business longevity**

##What if the worst happened?

1. All existing users started using PayPal instead of card.
2. No new users signed up.

Firstly points #1 and #2 contradict each other.

What I mean is, if PayPal influenced *every* existing user to switch, it is highly likely this same thing would attract a lot of new users (given the right marketing).

We can confidently assume all users that switched to PayPal are happier for doing so and as described above, happy users continue to use the product and help significantly with marketing.

As a welcome bonus, there would be no need to support card payments, as everyone uses PayPal which lowers ongoing development costs with the added bonus of simplifying the checkout flow; which is very likely to increase conversion with end results far exceeding 50p per order.

If you’re going to provide a feature, *always* make it easy to use.
