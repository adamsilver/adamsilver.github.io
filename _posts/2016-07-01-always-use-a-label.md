Sometimes designers oversimplify a form by removing the labels. The problem is
that [minimal does not always mean it’s
simple](http://uxmyths.com/post/115783813605/myth-34-simple-minimal) — which is
certainly the case for labels. Labels, in fact, are an essential part of
designing easy-to-use forms. Here’s why:

**A) Sighted users will see the instructions** and know what to do. Without a
label this is challenging at best.

<div class="image">
	<figure>
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/labels/1.png" alt="The visual label helps sighted users understand what to type" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px;">
		<figcaption>The visual label helps sighted users understand what to type</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

**B) Visually-impaired users will hear the instructions** when using a
screen reader. Without a label this is impossible.

<div class="image">
	<figure>
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/labels/2.png" alt="“Username” will be read out by screen readers" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px;">
		<figcaption>“Username” will be read out by screen readers</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

**C) Motor-impaired users will find it easier** to activate a control using a
mouse or finger, due to the hit region increasing in size. This is because
clicking (or tapping) a label acts as if the user clicked the control itself.

<div class="image">
	<figure>
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/labels/3.png" alt="Larger hit area helps motor-impaired users activate a control" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px;">
		<figcaption>Larger hit area helps motor-impaired users activate a control</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

## But sort/size/colour/quantity menus don’t need labels do they?

They do and unfortunately, it’s rather common to find missing labels on product forms.
[ASOS](http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Oversized-Long-Sleeve-T-Shirt-With-Mock-Underlayer/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=6593813&cid=13084&sh=0&pge=0&pgesize=36&sort=-1&clr=Grey&totalstyles=604&gridsize=3) suffers from this problem as you can see below:

<div class="image">
	<figure>
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/labels/asos.jpeg" alt="ASOS’ product form omits labels on drop downs" width="100%" style="max-width: 350px">
		<figcaption>ASOS’ product form omits labels on drop downs</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

Instead of a label, they rely on the first *option* in the menu to provide meaning. Whilst this is *sort of * okay for *visual* users in the non-selected state, it *does* suffer from points B and C — *and* A when a value has been selected — as is the case with the colourmenu as shown above.

[House of Fraser](http://www.houseoffraser.co.uk/Polo+Ralph+Lauren+Short-Sleeve+V-Neck+T-Shirt/233780500,default,pd.html) shows a label with their quantity menu improving usabilty for everyone:

<div class="image">
	<figure>
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/labels/hof.jpeg" alt="House of Fraser has a label for their quantity menu" width="100%" style="max-width: 350px">
		<figcaption>House of Fraser has a label for their quantity menu</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

## But a simple search form doesn’t need a label does it?

It does and unfortunately, search forms are often designed without a label. As
an example you can see [Selfridges ](http://www.selfridges.com/)below:

<div class="image">
	<figure>
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/labels/selfridges.png" alt="Selfridges’ search form omits the label" width="100%" style="max-width: 350px;">
		<figcaption>Selfridges’ search form omits the label</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

Instead of a label, they rely on the submit button (in this case a magnifying glass) and the placeholder to provide meaning. But this is unnecessarily difficult to use for less abled people — and of course —[placeholders should not be used as a replacement for
labels](https://medium.com/simple-human/10-reasons-why-placeholders-are-problematic-f8079412b960).

[Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/adamsilver/) shows that including a label can be both beautiful *and* functional at the same time:

<div class="image">
	<figure>
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/labels/smashing.jpeg" alt="Smashing Magazine’s search form uses a label" width="100%" style="max-width: 350px;">
		<figcaption>Smashing Magazine’s search form uses a label</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>

### Summary

Accommodating labels into a visual design can be challenging but [shying away from the challenge](https://medium.com/simple-human/the-design-challenge-6b2d5346da7a) is not the answer. Embrace the challenge, don’t over simplify. And of course, **always use a label.**
