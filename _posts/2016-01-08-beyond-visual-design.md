description: Can you design for everyone *and* make it visually beautiful?

In [How To Hire Designers](https://medium.com/intercom-inside/how-to-hire-designers-960663e3a3e6#.eu7al1wfu) Paul Adams explains that there are actually 4 major design disciplines: Outcome, System, Interaction and Visual.

The problem I have found is that often designers can spend far too much attention, time and effort on Visual Design to the detriment of the other 3 aspects which leads to a degraded User Experience.

Here are a handful of examples to explain what I am getting at:

> "We don't want to differentiate between buttons and links because we want a minimal design" &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** Clarity trumps minimalism every time.

> "I don't wan't the outline on elements when the user focuses or activates something in the browser, it doesn't look nice &mdash; how many people use a keyboard anyway? Most people use a mouse, we can't legislate for all users" &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** If we know there are people that use the keyboard then why not design for them? It's not just about how something looks, it's about how it works.

> "Most people with large screens use a mouse so we don't have to make it touch friendly" &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** Maybe more people use a mouse. But some people have large touch-enabled screens. Why not make the hit areas appropriate for everyone. Then if they use a mouse it's easy, if they use touch it's easy. Win win.

> "I don't want to clutter the design of the carousel with arrow buttons. Most small screen devices allow the user to swipe." &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** I am a fan of minimal design but this would be classed as making something too simple. Some browsers and devices don't support touch. These users will be forced to go elsewhere or endure a bad experience.

> "Mobile users swipe, desktop users don't." &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** There is no desktop, there is no mobile. There are browsers of varying sizes and capabilities. There are people with different preferences and abilities. They need our help and consideration.

> "I think the colour contrasts are fine, they work great on most new devices and that's our target audience"

**I say:** Acceptable contrasts make the clear clearer and the unclear clear. It might not be as visually pleasing as the subtle grey you had in-mind, but it will make the design easier to use.

> "A select box without a label is fine, it's unnecessary clutter" &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** Every form field needs a label; there are good reasons why. Legislate for this and make the design beautiful at the same time.

> "Most of our users are on a fast connection, it's important that we have 10 high resolution images on one page" &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** People on low-speed connections are likely not to wait for these beautiful images. Consider performance and how we can trim the fat for all. Faster connections become super fast, slow connections become satisfactory.

> "Can we fix that with Javascript? We don't need to worry about the 1% of users without it &mdash; it's important that the design is nice for 99% of our users" &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** First, [this](http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html). Second, it's not the amount of users, its the amount of visits. Javascript will fail to download/execute at some point. Embrace Progressive Enhancement. Every time you fix something with Javascript you take a hit in performance, maintenance and usability.

> "We need to fix that by disabling zoom on mobile" &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** Zoom is essential. Let go, [be boring](http://blog.capwatkins.com/the-boring-designer).

> "I don't like the way the text wraps and layout breaks on small screens, we'll get the copywriter to make the words fit" &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** Again, clarity trumps minimalism. [Design for content](https://www.uie.com/articles/content_and_design/) &mdash; not the other way around.

> "But website X does it, so we should do it" &mdash;<cite>Anon</cite>

**I say:** Sometimes website X does things, sometimes those things are ill-advised. Take this opportunity to do it better.

## Final thought

Can we not design for everyone? Can we not go beyond Visual Design? Can we legislate for all kinds of devices, screen sizes, capabilities and peoples interaction preferences? Isn't this part of the job? Isn't this *the* challenge that we face is designers and engineers?
