I'm not going to tell you *why* the hamburger sucks. James Archer has [done that](http://deep.design/the-hamburger-menu/) for me. Instead, I'll provide some alternatives responsive menus that avoid the hamburger.

## Example 1: Medium

<span class="figcaption_hack">Medium</span>

A big part of Medium’s success is in its simplicity and it can be seen in its
menu. If you’re reading this on a small screen you will see the menu takes up a
little more space by dropping down below the header.

You probably *didn’t* notice this.

That’s because like most people, you don’t care about the fine detail of
Medium’s design, you just want to use the site for its content.

## Example 2: Product Hunt

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dJCY2UhF9dirc7GEhUcfsg.png)
<span class="figcaption_hack">Product Hunt</span>

Product Hunt always displays the menu below the header, regardless of screen
size.

As there is not enough room for all the links, they wrap on to two lines. Whilst I am sure this menu could look a little nicer with a tad more effort, the menu
is still very user-friendly on small and big screens.

And, this particular website has a target audience of highly critical, industry
designers and developers, and it is still a very much loved website.

## Example 3: Node

<span class="figcaption_hack">Node</span>

You might be thinking “this guy is only demonstrating sites with very small
menus” so I give you Nodejs.org with **eight** links!

When in big screens the links are on one line, and when there is not enough
room, the links are simply put into two columns.

Out of all the examples this one takes up the most space. A few pixels could be
trimmed via reducing the size and space around the logo. But they needn’t
bother, this works.

## Example 4: adamsilver.io

<span class="figcaption_hack">adamsilver.io</span>

*Disclaimer: this is my own site that I am shamelessly plugging. Whatevs :)*

My site has 4 links for the moment, but this will be expanding to at least 5
soon enough. Luckily for me, I already have plenty of inspiration above.

## Example 5: Google Design

<span class="figcaption_hack">Google Design</span>

Google Design allows the user to horizontally scroll through the options.

Horizontal scrolling used to be ill-advised but on mobile devices this simple
approach works nicely and keeps working nicely when more and more links are
added.

## Example 6: The Minimalists

<span class="figcaption_hack">The Minimalists</span>

The Minimalists is designed true, to the message they are sending out. They have taken the approach of “let the browser do it’s thing”. The browser does what a browser does best. When there is not enough room, the links just wrap on to the next line.

## Summary

What I love about these examples is how *boringly simple* and
*user-friendly* they are. [User’s don’t mind scrolling](http://uxmyths.com/post/654047943/myth-people-dont-scroll) and it’s wise not to exert too much energy trying to fit everything above an imaginary fold.
