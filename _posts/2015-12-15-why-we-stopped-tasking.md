#tagline: And how this increased our velocity
---

Scrum advocates the breaking down of stories into tasks because: it helps to estimate more accurately, encourages collaboration and helps to show granular progress.

This used to make sense to me until I was working with someone who convinced me and the rest of the development team to stop tasking altogether. Once we did, we never looked back. Here's why:

## 1. We gained 60 hours back per sprint
At least 50% of our Sprint Planning sessions involved breaking down stories into tasks. When we stopped tasking, the sessions went down from about five hours to less than two. And considering our team had over 20 people we gained a lot of development time.

## 2. Defining tasks ahead of time is inaccurate

*"Weeks of programming can save you hours of planning."*

When coding it is inevitable that the solution will change as development unearths unforeseen scenarios and opportunity for improvement. This is why tasking is inaccurate. Don't bother, give yourself more time to code.

## 3. Many tasks are repetitive

Different stories typically require similar tasks: unit tests, a controller action, a view template, some JS enhancement, some styling etc. Specifying these as tasks wasn't helpful to us. We knew what we had to do and we had a clear Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria, which ensured the smooth delivery of each story.

## 4. Many tasks are carried out in parallel

Often many tasks are carried at at the same time. For example we would typically write HTML & CSS together as well as writing JS & unit tests together. Often the JS enhanced version would need extra HTML and CSS. This meant that most (if not all) tasks moved from in-progress to complete at the same time meaning we didn't show granular progress. We may as well have moved the entire story which is what we did in the end.

## 5. Our estimates didn't improve because of tasking

[Estimation is based on several things](http://illustratedagile.com/2012/11/13/the-5-stages-of-user-story-sizing/). Most importantly estimation comes from experience. Experience working together with a team you know well, on a particular project within a particular organisation. Only then will you have a predictable velocity.

## 6. The board was easier to use

Removing the tasks instantly decluttered the board. No longer did we cram hundreds of tasks into each swim lane. Instead we had a single card per story. Our board was easy to understand, use and explain.

## 7. We wasted less paper
Silly but true! A lot less trees were killed when stopped tasking.

## 8. Collaboration was achieved by the overall process

Our team didn't need tasks to enable collaboration. We sat in close proximity, had regular, useful and well-timed meetings, we paired when appropriate and had regular productive feedback loops.

## Final note

The great thing about Agile Scrum is that it encourages regular change through Retrospectives. It just so happens that one of the processes Scrum advocates doesn't always work so well.

**Question everything, look for friction, improve the process.**
