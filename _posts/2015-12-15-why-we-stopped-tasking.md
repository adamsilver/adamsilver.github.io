#tagline: And how this increased our velocity
description: Tasking can be painful when you do it ahead of time. Don't blindly follow Scrum. Question everything. Increase velocity.

Scrum advocates breaking down stories into tasks because it:

1. makes story estimation easier
2. encourages collaboration
3. enables the team to show granular process during a sprint.

When one of my colleagues convinced me and the team to stop it we increased our velocity significantly. Here's why:

## 1. We didn't need to spend time tasking

At least 50% of our Sprint Planning sessions was spent breaking down stories into tasks. For our team of over 20 people, we gained almost 60 man-hours back per sprint.

## 2. Tasking ahead of development is inaccurate

Solutions change during development due to unforseen scenarios. Only through coding might you find opportunites for improvement. A lot of our tasks weren't accurate which meant tasking had negative value.

Don't bother, give yourself more time to code instead.

## 3. Tasks are repetitive

A lot of the stories required many of the same tasks. For example unit tests, a controller action, a template, some Javascript and styling enhancements etc. These things were always going to happen.

Writing them as tasks wasn't valuable. Instead we relied on a clear Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria. Both of which ensured the smooth delivery of each story.

## 4. Many tasks are carried out in parallel

Tasks are often carried out at the same time. For example, we would  write HTML & CSS together. Often the JS-enhanced version would need extra HTML and CSS.

This meant that a lot of tasks moved from "in-progress" to "complete" at the same time. We never showed granular progress. In the end we just moved the Story card.

## 5. Estimates didn't improve

[Estimation is based on several things](http://illustratedagile.com/2012/11/13/the-5-stages-of-user-story-sizing/). Estimation comes from experience. Experience working together with a team you know well, on a particular project within a particular organisation. Only then will you have a predictable velocity.

## 6. It's easier to understand the task board

Removing tasks decluttered the task board significantly. We no longer had to fit tasks into each swim lane. Instead we had a single card per story.

## 7. We wasted less paper

We saved trees. We saved money. What's not to like about that?

## 8. The overall process encouraged us to collaborate

We didn't need tasks to help us collaborate. We sat in close proximity. We had regular, useful and well-timed meetings. We paired when appropriate and had regular productive feedback loops. All of this added up to a collaborative environment.

## Summary

If you're tasking and it works for you, good. But take some time and consider if it's really helping.
