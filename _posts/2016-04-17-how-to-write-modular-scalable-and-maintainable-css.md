Have you ever updated some CSS only to cause regression elsewhere? Have you ever inherited a large codebase and been afraid to touch it? Have you ever wanted to remove redundant code, but you just didn’t feel confident enough to do so?

Yes? Me too!

Wouldn’t it be nice to write and architect your styles *without* worrying about all of these things and more?

Yep&mdash;thought so!

Introducing [MaintainableCSS](http://maintainablecss.com)&mdash;an approach to writing scalable, modular, and of course maintainable CSS.

Born out of experiencing all the same problems and frustrations that you have probably had, I realised that a combination of [semantics](http://maintainablecss.com/chapters/semantics/) and [reuse](http://maintainablecss.com/chapters/reuse/) (not how you might think) are reasons why we can get our knickers in a twist with CSS.

*MaintainableCSS* isn’t something you can download&mdash;it’s a very simple set of guidelines, explaining how to write CSS for your project.

Give it a try (you can read and apply the principles in minutes), and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions, because I would love to hear from you.

Oh, and lastly, there will be more chapter coming soon, so watch out for those.
