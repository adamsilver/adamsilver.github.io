Have you ever designed something hard-to-use on purpose? I once worked at a
successful e-commerce company that did this very thing.

They wanted users to be able to pay by PayPal. Just as we started development
the business stopped us because they were concerned with the design.

Specifically, they were concerned with how easy it was to choose Paypal. This is what it looked like:

<span class="figcaption_hack">Payment choice page</span>

The issue was that when users paid by card, we received fifty pence as a
transaction fee. If the user paid by Paypal we would get nothing.

If you’re taking 750,000 orders per week, fifty pence is a lot to lose.

The business wanted us to hide Paypal behind some sort of expand/collapse panel. In other words, to make Paypal hard to find.

But then why give users the choice at all?

We knew our users *wanted* PayPal and many people *only* shop with PayPal for
security *and* convenience reasons.

We also knew our users drop off during checkout for many reasons. Each person
that drops off costs the business a lot more than fifty pence. The average order value was about £20.

## **What would happen if we added PayPal as originally designed?**

It’s hard to know. But I think that:

* a small percentage of existing users would’ve started using PayPal
* and we would’ve attracted new users to the site.

But even if lots of people switched over to Paypal, they would like be happier
for doing so. They likely find it more convenient and perceptively more secure.

A happy user is one that purchases more frequently. Or at least continues to use the service at the same frequency.

Also, a happy user is more likely to recommend the service to friends. That must be worth massive amounts in marketing terms.

Mid-to-late adopters need a nudge before they make the jump. PayPal could
provide a welcome tipping point to attract new users.

And, if our competitors offered PayPal, users may decide to switch.

*So to sum up: keep users happy (+ attract new users) = business longevity*

## What if the worst happened?

The worse case scenario might include:

* All existing users switching to Paypal (no transaction free received).
* and no new users signing up

First, both of these points contradict each other. If Paypal makes existing
users switch I would imagine the service would attract new users.

Second, all of our users would be happier using Paypal. That’s why they
switched.

Third, there is no need to offer the ability to pay by card. This reduces the
cost of development.

Fourth, the checkout flow is even easier to use as there is no choice in payment type. This would likely result in an uptick in conversion.

All of this to say, this is worth a lot more than 50p per order.

#### Summary

If you’re going to provide a feature, always make it easy-to-use. Or just don’t
bother.
