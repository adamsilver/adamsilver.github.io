The role of the Frontend developer has changed significantly over the years and responsiblities extend far beyond translating visual designs into code. Recently, Frontend developers should be involved in many other aspects of the design and development process.

## User Experience (UX)

Everyone is responsible for UX [[0](#ref0)] and Frontend Developers play an essential role [[1](#ref1)]. Due to the nature of their job, they should understand the platform better than anyone else. Having to develop for a huge range of browsers, across different Operating Systems and devices with different configurations means the Frontend developer truly understands the constraints of the web and embraces them to the users' advantage. This input is vital for creating a positive UX.

## Frontend architecture

An *experienced* Frontend developer should be able to design a suitable frontend architecture which includes the consideration of the following:

* Design patterns
* Architectural patterns
* Bootstrapping strategies
* Bundling and compression
* Modularity and semantics
* Technical contracts between backend and frontend. Namely view models and XmlHttpRequest end-points
* Code style and convention
* Testing and automation

## Accessibility

The beauty of the web is one of reach; deploy once and access everywhere; there are just two requirements: a browser and an Internet connection. Oh and of course a competent Frontend developer who won't fuck up your website [[2](#ref2)]. Frontend developers are responsible and should take pride in the fact that, the UIs they build, are accessible to everyone, no matter their age, ability, user interaction preferences and, choice of device, Operating System and browser. Frontend developers are *normally* speaking, the only advocates of accessibility and as accessibility is intertwined with usability, it's vital to be knowledgeable in the practice and to champion it readily.

## Frontend feature writing

Given a well defined and suitable frontend architecture, adding new features and updating existing features will include the writing of HTML, CSS and Javscript. This should include writing unit tests and (at least helping to write) automated functional tests.

## Search Engine Optimisation

Much like Accessibility, it is imperative Frontend developers understand how to build web pages that are search-engine friendly, so that appropriate indexing can take place in order to surface the content of the web page to their users.

## Frontend performance

It is important Frontend developers understand various facets of performance ensuring that web pages are served and run as fast as possible without degrading the UX [[4](#ref4)]. This includes a good knowledge of browser caching, compression, bundling and runtime performance on the client.

## Browser compatibility

Frontend developers should endeavour to test in as many browsers as is reasonable when developing, but will understand there is a balance to be had, as testing all browsers, in all compatibilities, on all devices is a sisyphean task. The balance can only be struck through experience of knowing which spread of browsers should be tested and at which frequency. Leaning on cross-browser scripting [[5](#ref5)] minimises the worry behind a lack of manual browser testing coverage.

## Development process and methodologies

Whilst not specifically related to Frontend developers, it is very important to be able to work as part of a team in a given process. This means an understanding of various Agile methodologies. Better still, it's highly beneficial to you and your team to be able to spot friction and influence the process regularly to deliver software in a more efficient way.
