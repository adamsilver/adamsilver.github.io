# My team

I don't know about you, but I have worked with people that make me much better at what I do. People who motivate me or inspire me, complement my strengths and shore up my weaknesses&mdash;they even help me achieve things that I couldn't do on my own.

If you're interested in hiring me, then you might be interested in hiring my friends too. These people aren't *just* my friends&mdash;they are extremely brilliant at what they do. Let me tell you a little bit about them:

## Mark Jenkins

Mark is not only modest, but he is also the most talented UX designer I have ever worked with. He immerses himself deeply into whatever project he works on and he has a mastery of people. He has to have this ability for two reasons&mdash;first, to lead his team and second, to design experiences for them. Everything Mark says is honest, sensible, thought out and inspiring.

## Graham Veal

Graham is a brillaint UI engineer. But he is so much more than that. He also has complimentary skills in Node.js, devops and photography. He is always personally invested in doing the *right* thing and he goes about his day quietly and productively to do just that.

## Jonathan Perry

Jonathan is the most experienced Javascript developer I have worked with. He has been building out sophisticated web applications since the very beginning. A quiet but highly experienced talent that you'll always want on your team.

## Interested in us?

Often agencies want a team. We can make up all or some of that team depending on your needs. If we can't help with every requirement, we'll certainly be able to help fill in the gaps.

We think it's better if you take us through the hiring process together. We can't promise we'll all be available at the same time but we'll certainly do our best.

We're excited to work with you. So please [get in touch](mailto:adambsilver+team@gmail.com) about your next project.
