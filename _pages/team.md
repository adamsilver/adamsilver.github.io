# Team

I don't know about you, but I have worked with people that make me incredibly better at what I do. People who motivate me or inspire me, complement my strengths and shore up my weaknesses&mdash;they even help me achieve things that I couldn't do on my own.

If you are interested in hiring me, then you might find a lot of value in hiring my friends. These people aren't just my friends&mdash;they are extremely brilliant at what they do, and compliment my skillset superbly.

Let me tell you a little bit about them.

## Mark Jenkins

Mark is the most modest and brilliant UX designer I have met. He cares deeply about the projects he works on and he has a mastery of people. The first is the way he works with and leads people on his team and the second is the way he designs experiences for them. Everything he says is sensible, thoughtful and inspiring.

## Graham Veal

Graham is the most cross-functional developer I have worked with. One that you can trust to do it right whereever on the stack he is working. He has excellent knowledge on building out UIs but is particularly skilled and a bit in love with Node.js. He is also quietly talented in devops. He get's it, he can explain it, and he can do it.

## Jonathan Perry

Jonathan is the most experienced Javascript developer I have worked with. He did it before it could be done if you know what I mean. A team player, a quiet talent and hilarious once he lets rip. You'll want him on your team.

## Steve Uprichard

Steve is one of the best UI developers I know. But he also has entrepreneurial tendencies having founded two separate businesses. He is also extremely fun to have around the office.

## Want to hire all or some of us?

Often agencies want a team. We may not have all the talent you need but we can certainly help cover a lot of it and help you find the rest.

We think it's better if you take us through the hiring process together. We can't promise we'll all be available at the same time but we'll do our best.

*We're excited to work with you!*
