# Adam Silver who?

My name is Adam and my mission is to make the web better. A *lot* better!

**I know this sounds like a big undertaking and it is!** You see I have been doing this since I can remember (over 15 years) and in that time I have built over 50 large-scale websites for huge house-hold names such as Tesco, Boots, Just Eat, Selfridges, Financial Times and so many others.

I absolutely love working with others to solve *real* problems in a simple and human way which always works out best for people using your website. I've learnt so from doing and from other great people that I like to share all the things I've learnt with you. So if this sounds interesting to you, sign up below.

In addition to that I have written a handy little book that will seriously help you build modular, scalable and maintainable CSS called [MaintainableCSS](http://maintainablecss.com) which has had over 250,000 readers.

When I am not doing this stuff, you can find me running outside, playing sport and spending precious time with my beautiful wife and little boy.
