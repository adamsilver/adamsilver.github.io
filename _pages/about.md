# Adam Silver who?

My name is Adam and my mission is to enhance people's lives, by designing and building delightful experiences on the web.

I have been doing this since I can remember (15+ years) and in that time I have built countless large-scale websites for huge house-hold names such as Tesco, BBC, Argos, Boots, Just Eat, News Corp, Selfridges, Financial Times, T-Mobile and many others.

I believe design is a team sport. And I love working together to solve *real* problems, led by user needs. I've learnt from *doing* and from working with other great people in the industry. Ultimately, I get satisfaction helping others avoid all my past mistakes.

I've also written a little book about maintainable CSS. Because I'm so creative I called it [MaintainableCSS](http://maintainablecss.com) :-).

When I am not doing this stuff, you can find me running outside, playing tennis and spending time with my family.
