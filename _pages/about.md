# Adam Silver who?

I get my kicks by designing simple, human and inclusive experiences that make people feel awesome.

I have been doing this since I can remember (15+ years) and in that time I have built countless large-scale websites for huge house-hold names such as Tesco, BBC, Argos, Boots, Just Eat, News Corp, Selfridges, Financial Times, T-Mobile and many others.

Design is a team sport&mdash;I love working with other people to solve *real* problems that help users. Ultimately, I get satisfaction helping others avoid all my past mistakes.

I've also written a little book about maintainable CSS. Because I'm so creative I called it [MaintainableCSS](http://maintainablecss.com).

When I am not doing this, you'll find me running, playing tennis and spending time with my family.
