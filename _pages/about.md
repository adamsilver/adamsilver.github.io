# About me

My name is Adam. And my mission is to make the web better. A *lot* better.

I know this sounds like a pretty big undertaking. It is! I like to think I have influenced little pockets of the web, through working with developers and designers alike, tweeting and writing articles, some of which have made the front page of Hacker News.

Since 2000 I have been designing and building websites. I come from the view-source, teach-yourself school of web development. When you build stuff for the web, you learn about so many little things that affect the User Experience.

In 2002 my attention moved purely to development where I became obsessed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I let much better designers provide design assets that I would *code up* as it were.

In 2008 I started to work very closely with the client and increasingly played an integral role influencing the UX. I have spent quite a lot of time as a UX designer, but more time as a Front-end Developer.

Today I don't believe so much in designing and developing separately. I have had the best results working closely *with* design and development from ideation to production.

For me it's not just about working with *design*. It's also about working with Product, QA, Copywriters, Researchers, Developers (Back-end, front-end, full stack), Scrum Masters etc.

This is why I am a massive Agile fan. I believe in choosing the essential things to build and frequently improving the process to reduce friction.
