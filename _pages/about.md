# About me

My name is Adam. And my mission is to make the web better. A *lot* better.

I know this sounds like a pretty big undertaking. It is! I like to think I have influenced little pockets of the web, through working with developers and designers alike, tweeting and writing articles, some of which have made the front page of Hacker News.

Since 2000, I have been designing and building websites. I come from the view source, teach yourself, school of web development. When you build stuff for the web, you learn about so many little things that affect the User Experience.

Whilst I have always had a good eye for design, I have never had the *visual* design skills to be a visual designer. In 2002, my attention moved purely to development where I became obsessed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I let much better designers provide design assets that I would *code up* as it were.

In 2008, I started to work very closely with the client and increasingly played an integral role influencing the UX. I have spent time as Lead UX designer and spent a heck of a lot more time as Lead Front-end Developer.

Today, I don't believe so much in designing and developing separately. I have had the best results working closely *with* UX from inception to production.

For me it's not just about working with *design*. It's about working with all elements of the team, Product, QA, Design, Back-end Dev, Front-end Dev, Scrum master etc.

This is why I am a massive fan of Agile principles. I believe in choosing the essential things to build, in the right order and improving the process regularly, so that the team can deliver quickly and with high quality. It also enables frequent learning and iteration.

In a nutshell, I love building great experiences on the web. I think beauty is simplicity.

Anyway, I am now starting to waffle. If you want to find out more you know what to do.
