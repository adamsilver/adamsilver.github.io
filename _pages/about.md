# About me

My name is Adam. And my mission is to make the web better. A *lot* better.

I know this sounds like a pretty big undertaking. It is! I like to think I have influenced little pockets of the web, through working with developers and designers alike, tweeting and writing articles, some of which have made the front page of Hacker News.

Since 2000, I have been designing and building websites. I come from the view source, teach yourself, school of web. When you build stuff for the web, you learn about so many little things that affect the User Experience.

Whilst I have always had a good eye for design, I have never had the *visual* design skills to be a visual designer. In 2002, my attention moved purely to development where I became obsessed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I let much better designers provide design assets that I would *code up* as it were.

In 2008, I started to work very closely with the end client and influenced the user experience more and more. I have spent time as Lead UX designer and spent a heck of a lot more time as Lead Front-end Developer.

Today, I don't believe so much in designing and developing separately. I have had the best results working closely *with* UX from inception to production.

The *working with* thing doesn't stop there. I believe it's important that developers and designers must work closely with product and the business so that you can build essentially. Choosing the right things to build and in the right order. In other words MVP.

Just like design shouldn't be done separately, neither should *managing*. In order to design well, you need to understand communication. In order to communicate well you need to understand the business. In order to understand the business, you need to *understand* the business.
