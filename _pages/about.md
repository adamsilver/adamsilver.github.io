# About me

My name is Adam. And my mission is to make the web better. A *lot* better.

I know this sounds like a pretty big undertaking. It is! I like to think I have influenced little pockets of the web, through working with developers and designers alike, tweeting and writing articles, some of which have made the front page of Hacker News.

Since 2000 I have been designing and building websites. I come from the view-source, teach-yourself school of web development. When you build stuff for the web, you learn about so many little things that affect the User Experience.

Whilst I have always had a good eye for design, I have never acquired the *visual* design skills to be a visual designer &mdash; at least one of the quality I would be proud of.

In 2002 my attention moved purely to development where I became obsessed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I let much better designers provide design assets that I would *code up* as it were.

In 2008 I started to work very closely with the client and increasingly played an integral role influencing the UX. I have spent quite a lot of time as a UX designer, but spent much more as a Front-end Developer.

Today, I don't believe so much in designing and developing separately. I have had the best results working closely *with* design and development from inception to production.

For me it's not just about working with *design*. It's about working with all elements of the team: Product, QA, Design, Copywriters, Researchers, Back-end, Front-end, Scrum master etc.

This is why I am a massive fan of the Agile philosophy. I believe in choosing the essential things to build, in the right order, with the right people. And frequently improving the process, so that all this can be done with as little friction as possible.

**In a nutshell I love designing and building humanised and simple experiences.**
