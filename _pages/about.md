# Adam Silver who?

I design (and build) simple, human and inclusive digital services&mdash;websites really. But, my superhero power is fighting complexity at every turn.

Since the turn of the century I've done this for Tesco, BBC, Argos, Boots, Just Eat, News Corp, Selfridges, The Financial Times, T-Mobile and many others too.

I believe that design is a team sport. The best experiences are those produced by multi-disciplinary and diverse teams. I love working with other experts to help them avoid my past mistakes and to meet user's needs.

I wrote a little book about how to craft maintainable interfaces with CSS. Because I'm so creative I called it [MaintainableCSS](http://maintainablecss.com).

When I am not doing this, you'll find me running, playing tennis and spending time with my family.
