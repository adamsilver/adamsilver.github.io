Some of my subscribers send me messages:

> “Your newsletter is one of the most interesting and on-point things I like to read these days”

I've written for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/adamsilver/), [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/author/adamsilver) and [Net Magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine) about designing simple, human and inclusive websites. But mostly, I write one article a month and share it with my mailing list. You can read [Stop Using Device Breakpoints](/articles/stop-using-device-breakpoints/) for an example.
