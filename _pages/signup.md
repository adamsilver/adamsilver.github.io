# Sign up to my private newsletter

I write for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/improving-ux-for-color-blind-users/) and the [Simple=Human](http://medium.com/simple-human) Medium publication which I setup with my friend [Mark Jenkins](http://theluckystrike.co.uk). Some of my articles have also been featured on the front-page of Hacker News.

You can expect an email once-a-month ish. You'll get the best of what I've got before anyone else. You can unsubscribe at any time but please don't :).
