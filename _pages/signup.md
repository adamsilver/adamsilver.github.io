# Join my newsletter

Some of my subscribers send me messages:

> “Your newsletter is one of the most interesting and on-point things I like to read these days”


I sometimes write for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/adamsilver/), [Net Magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine), [MarvelApp](https://blog.marvelapp.com/author/adam-silver/) and  [Simple=Human](http://medium.com/simple-human) about designing simple, human and inclusive websites.

But mostly I write one article a month and share it with my mailing list. If you want an example you should read [Stop Using Device Breakpoints](/articles/stop-using-device-breakpoints/).
