# I am writing a book...

I am obsessed with forms. And because they are such an important part of a friction-free web experience, I have decided to write a book about how to make them great.

Don't worry, I will still be writing the odd article as per normal, but I will also keep you up to date on the book in the form of free chapters, so you can get a sneaky preview.
