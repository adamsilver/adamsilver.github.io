# About me

Around 2000 years old I was at school doing my A-levels and one of the modules was titled 'Website Design'. I remember playing with Geocities and other free hosting providers and I just loved the mix of creative, technical, problem solving and magic skills required to do this stuff.

I endlessly hacked in various HTML, CSS, JS and even some VBScript as I tried to make the pages as fancy looking as possible. To my knowledge these sites don't exist any more and that's probably a good thing.

Flash was also this wonderfully fancy technology and I spent hours and hours learning to create motion tweens as ActionScript was too much for my brain.

Soon after I started creating websites for various clients through friends and family; anything from music bands to small businesses. It was really fun and the money was great considering I had been doing it for 2 mins, but most of all it was really fun.

I found myself obsessed with how e-commerce sites worked i.e. add to basket (ATB). View source couldn't help me :( At this point I knew this was what I wanted to do so I went to the University of Hertfordshire to study Multimedia Technology with endeavour of learning my trade professionally and hopefully answering the mystical ATB puzzle. In the end I cracked it and in my 2nd year I built an e-commerce website using Classic ASP to sell trainers.

Toward the end of uni, tableless layouts were the big thing and so my obsession shifted to front end development. I finished uni and got a local job working for a small web design firm where I was responsible for most things: design, front end, back end (Classic ASP), SQL database schemas, project management everything. This place didn't have source control is what I remember the most about that place.

A year later I flew the nest and joined a very large full service digital agency called LBi as an Interface Developer which was great as I could learn to become an expert in the one area.
