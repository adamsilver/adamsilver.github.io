# About me

Around 2000 I was at school doing my A-levels and one of the modules was titled 'Website Design'. I remember playing with Geocities and other free hosting providers and I just loved the mix of creative, technical and problem solving skills required to do this stuff.

I endlessly hacked in various HTML, CSS, JS and even some VBScript as I tried to make the web pages look fancy. To my knowledge these sites don't exist any more and that's probably a good thing ;).

There was nothing fancier than Flash and so I spent hours and hours learning to create motion tweens. ActionScript was too much for my brain at the time.

Soon after I started creating websites for various clients through friends and family; anything from music bands to small businesses. It was really fun and the money was great considering I had been doing it for 2 mins, but most of all it was really fun.

I found myself obsessed with how e-commerce sites worked i.e. add to basket (ATB). View source couldn't help me :( At this point I knew this was what I wanted to do so I went to the University of Hertfordshire to study Multimedia Technology with the endeavour of learning my trade professionally and hopefully answering the mystical ATB puzzle in the process. In the end I cracked it and in my 2nd year I built an e-commerce website using Classic ASP to sell trainers.

Toward the end of university, tableless layouts were the big thing and so my obsession shifted to front end development. I got 1st degree honours and got a local job working for a small web design firm where I was responsible for most things: design, front end, back end (Classic ASP), SQL database schemas, project management, everything! The one thing I remember the most about the place was the lack of version control - ah good times as people shouted across the office "don't touch this, I am working on it".

A year later I flew the nest and joined a very large full service digital agency called LBi as an Interface Developer which was great as I could learn to become an expert in the one area I enjoyed most - the front end. I became friends with one of the senior developers who fortunately really knew his JS. He mentored me and this was invaluable at such an early stage of my career.
