# About me

Around 2000 I was at school doing my A-levels and one of the modules was titled 'Website Design'. I remember playing with Geocities and other free hosting providers and I just loved the mix of creative, technical and problem solving skills required to build a website.

I endlessly hacked in various HTML, CSS, JS and even some VBScript as I tried to make the web pages look fancy. There was nothing fancier than Flash and so I spent hours and hours learning to create motion tweens as ActionScript was too much for my brain at the time.

Soon after I started creating websites for various clients through friends and family; anything from music bands to small businesses. It was really fun and the money was great considering I had been doing it for less than 6 months, but most of all it was really fun.

I found myself obsessed with how e-commerce sites worked, in particular shopping baskets. Good old "view source" couldn't help me and at this point I knew my career path. So I went to the University of Hertfordshire to study Multimedia Technology with the endeavour of learning my trade professionally and hopefully answering the mystical shopping basket puzzle in the process. In my 2nd year I built an e-commerce website using Classic ASP to sell trainers 
and solved the shopping basket puzzle once and for all - who knew there was a
 server side?

Toward the end of university, tableless layouts were all the rage and so my obsession shifted to the front end development. I achieved 1st degree honours and got a local job working for a small web design business where I was responsible for most things: design, front end, back end (Classic ASP), SQL database schemas, project management, everything! The one thing I remember the most about the place was the lack of version control - ah good times as people shouted across the office "don't touch this, I am working on it".

A year later I flew the nest and joined a very large full service digital agency as an Interface Developer which was great as I could learn to become an expert in the one area I enjoyed most - the front end. I soon realised that I had a gaping hole in my knowledge. Dun dun dun: Javascript. I put a lot of hours learning it and I became friends with one of the senior developers who fortunately really knew his JS. His mentoring was invaluable.

Soon after, jQuery was released and appeared to make DOM scripting easy, abstracting away all the browser inconsistencies. After several years of using jQuery and other libraries I came across a host of bugs and issues with such libraries that I started to dig a little deeper. I wanted to find a better way. I stumbled across a linked in post by David Mark explaining the pitfalls of jQuery and mentioned his own library. Something about it just resonated with me. I really liked the fact that each function did one specific thing - the complete opposite of `$`. It also was backed completely by feature detection and testing.

Years later at a different company one guy pointed me in the direction of some David Mark comp.lang.javascript posts where he critiqued the jQuery source code and provided ways of doing it better. I was completely hooked and couldn't believe it. Everything I relied upon had poor foundations so ever since then I have been trying to create cross browser functions from scratch leaning on David Mark where necessary. See Jessie on Github for more on that.

As a result, I am far more knowledgeable, can spot flaws in common popular libraries and avoid trying to build UI components that won't work cross browser and normally results in better UX anyway.
